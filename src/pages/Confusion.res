      {React.string("As consumers we encounter confusion through fashion media such as webshops and social media channels. With a growing urgency towards the wellbeing of our planet, people are changing their consumption behavior into a more sustainable one. The need for sustainable products are met by companies and initiatives but not all in a truthful manner, better known as greenwashing. The tactics of greenwashing are devious, as consumers can’t visually or communicatively distinguish true and false companies, websites or products. The effectiveness of ethical consumption becomes questionable when deception comes into play. As politics distances itself from the free market, and makes the consumer decide, they facilitate space for untruthful fashion practises to capitalize on this confusion. When we make a poor choice by trusting a company for making ethical products, it is our own fault  that we made a wrong choice whilst being a victim of deceit. Sustainability in itself is a confusing concept as it persists in multiple contexts even within inherently unsustainable ones such as fast fashion. It is hard to distinguish real sustainable products, but it is more complex than unfolding the truth or discovering a lie. It is about perspectives and our different realities of the truth. We measure the truth with facts, we measure the truthfulness by the intention of what is being told. The intention to manipulate or deceit is ontruthfull, but one person within a questionable company can still act in a truthful manner. Confusion is approached in fashion as a strategy to accelerate or create consumption. The fashion industry uses tactics that seduce us into buying new pieces for our ever growing wardrobe. The fashion industry thrives on confusion as it was built on a form of deception.

      {React.string("The essay centralizes the concept confusion within fashion communication regarding sustainable consumption. The essay is a manifestation of my research that introduces confusion, defines where it occurs and who benefits from this confusion with the aim to soften consumer guilt. The confusion is mapped through a mix of theory, popular texts and visualisations. The essay uses the method of questioning in order to engage and activate the reader. The confusion unfolds itself in four chapters: ourselves, the social political system, the zeitgeist and the fashion industry. This essay encompasses the complexity of sustainable consumption. Sustainability has become a catch-all term. Everyone has their own significance of the word but what does it mean if even fast fashion can be called sustainable. This essay introduces confusion as an essential aspect in the sustainability discourse as it counteracts the sustainable development in western neoliberal capitalism.
